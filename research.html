    <h2>Difference between a therapy dog and a service dog </h2>

    Service Dogs, Working Dogs, Therapy Dogs, Emotional Support Dogs: What’s the Difference?https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/service-working-therapy-emotional-support-dogs/
    
    Therapeutic Visitation Animals: These are household pets that are trained and taken to hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, 
    and other locations, who provide comfort and joy for people that are living away from home due to mental or physical illnesses.<br>
    Animal Assisted Therapy Animals: These animals work with physical and occupational therapists in a rehabilitation setting to <br>
    assist individuals in meeting their recovery goals.
    Facility Therapy Animals: These animals work in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. They assist residents that have <br>
    Alzheimer’s, dementia, or other mental illnesses, and are generally cared for and provided by the facility.<br>
    An emotional support animal is typically a dog, cat, or another small domesticated animal that provides mental and emotional 
    health benefits for its owner. An emotional support animal does not need any specialized training. ESAs provide support through <br>
    their companionship and presence. A wide variety of animals serve as ESAs, but dogs are perhaps the most popular due to their<br>
     affection, loyalty, and emotional intelligence. 
    Qualities of an Ideal Therapy Dog
    Dogs of any breed, size, or age may be eligible to become therapy dogs. However, not every dog is cut out to be a therapy <br>
    animal. Whether they were bred specifically to work or they come from shelters or rescues, candidates must possess certain traits<br>
     in order to qualify as therapy dogs.
    Temperament is, by far, the most important trait. Before entering an animal-assisted therapy training program, the dog must be 
    friendly, confident, non-aggressive, patient, calm, gentle, and receptive to training. The dog must get along remarkably well <br>
    with men, women, children, and other animals. The dog should not be highly fearful or nervous. Socialization and a solid foundation<br>
     of training are important for all dogs and puppies, but absolutely essential for a dog to be considered for a therapy program.<br>

    <h2>BREEDS OF STRAY DOGS</h2>
     
    What breed are street dogs in India?
    Pariah Dog
    The street dogs found in India are a big mix of different breeds over the years but the most common trait or breed used to <br>
    define the Indian street dogs is the Pariah Dog. We personally don't like this name as Pariah means 'Outsider' and this namesake<br>
     was given by the British during their ruling in India.
    Indian pariah dog
    It is easily trainable and often used as a guard dog and police dog. This dog is an example of an ancient group of dogs known as<br>
     pye-dogs.
    Are Indian street dogs good pets?
    Often people in India generalize stray dogs to be much worse than pure-bred dogs various reasons. Be it health or looks,
     these people are often very misunderstood. Stray dogs are just as good as other dogs, if not better. ... Often subjected to <br>
     physical abuse, conditions of stray dogs deteriorate rapidly in India.</p>
     <p class="text-center my-4" style="color:saddlebrown "> 
    <h2>DOGS age</h2>
    The aging profile of dogs varies according to their adult size (often determined by their breed): smaller dogs often live over<br>
     15–16 years, medium and large size dogs typically 10 to 13 years, and some giant dog breeds such as mastiffs, often only 
     7 to 8 years.
    At what age a puppy should be trained?
    Young puppies have short attention spans but you can expect them to begin to learn simple obedience commands such as “sit,” <br>
    “down,” and “stay,” as young as 7 to 8 weeks of age. Formal dog training has traditionally been delayed until 6 months of age.
    Can a dog be trained at any age?
    While most people associate training with puppies, the reality is that dogs can learn at any age. Adult dogs are often easier <br>
    to train than young puppies because they have more self-control. It's also important to keep training your dog as it matures.<br>
    From 4-6 Months. You may notice that your puppy likes to play-fight with other dogs around this age. This is how puppies start 
    to identify where they fit in with a group. This is normal behavior.
